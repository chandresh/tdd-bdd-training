BDD

As a visitor, when I visit the homepage, I should be able to see:

	- featured products
	- categories on the sidebar
	- list of bestsellers

Cucumber for outside [routes & views <= acceptance testing or integration]
Rspec for the inside [Controllers &models <= unit testing]

-------------------

1. add gems

group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
end

group :test do
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'cucumber', '1.2.5'
  gem 'cucumber-rails', '1.3.0', require: false
  gem 'database_cleaner'
end

2. run generators // command

bundle
rails g rspec:install
rails g cucumber:install
rake db:migrate; rake db:test:prepare

3. write the feature

root/features/website.feature

Feature: As a visitor
  I should be able to visit the homepage

  Scenario: visit homepage
    When I visit the homepage
    Then it should work

4. run the features

cucumber features/website.feature

If you get errors^^^

bundle exec cucumber features/website.feature

5. Copy the steps from the command output to website_steps.rb

When(/^I visit the homepage$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then(/^it should work$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

6. Change the code:

When(/^I visit the homepage$/) do
  visit root_path
end

7. Run cucumber again:

bundle exec cucumber features/website.feature

See the error:

undefined local variable or method `root_path'

8. Create the root route in routes.rb

root :to => 'welcome#index'

9. Run cucumber again:

uninitialized constant WelcomeController

---------------
We will move to rspec to create a controller_spec

10. We write a controller spec

11. Run

rspec spec/controllers/welcome_controller_spec.rb

 see the error

12. create controller

13.. again run spec..

14. Created second feature: category
15. Created steps
16. Run the cucumber test
17. Change the view
18. Created controller test for validations
19. created the validation
20. run the spec test
21â€¦
