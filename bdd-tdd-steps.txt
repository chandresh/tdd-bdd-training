BDD

As a visitor, when I visit the homepage, I should be able to see:

	- featured products
	- categories on the sidebar
	- list of bestsellers

Cucumber for outside [routes & views <= acceptance testing or integration]
Rspec for the inside [Controllers &models <= unit testing]

-------------------

1. add gems

group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
end

group :test do
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'cucumber', '1.2.5'
  gem 'cucumber-rails', '1.3.0', require: false
  gem 'database_cleaner'
end

2. run generators // command

bundle
rails g rspec:install
rails g cucumber:install
rake db:migrate; rake db:test:prepare
